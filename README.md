Insights from the Analysis:

1.	Top 10 Countries by Views: The analysis reveals the top countries with the highest YouTube viewership. Countries such as the US, India, and Brazil often lead in viewership, offering valuable insights into the most engaged audiences worldwide.
   
2.	Total Income: Income generated by YouTube channels is strongly linked to ads, views, and subscriber counts. This analysis sheds light on estimated income trends across different regions and content categories, indicating which types of content—such as gaming, education, or entertainment—are the most profitable.
   
3.	Engagement Metrics: Key metrics like likes, comments, and shares provide a clear picture of audience engagement. Diving deeper into how different categories (tutorials, vlogs, music videos) perform in terms of interaction can yield crucial insights for content creators.

4.	Income Distribution: The income distribution on YouTube is highly skewed, with a small percentage of creators earning a large portion of the revenue. A Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plot visualizes this income disparity, showing how concentrated earnings are across the platform.
      
5.	Most Popular Content Categories: Identifying the categories with the most views and engagement—such as entertainment, music, and education—offers insights into audience preferences and evolving trends over time.
   
6.	Growth Trends: Analysing time-series data reveals YouTube’s growth trajectory, including rising daily active users and content consumption trends, providing a forecast for the platform’s future growth.
	
7.	Correlations: The analysis highlights correlations between key variables, such as views and income or subscribers and upload frequency, offering insights into what drives success on YouTube.

8. Density Chart of Total Income : The density chart of total income shows a skewed distribution. A significant portion of channels generates relatively lower income, while a few high-performing outliers account for a large proportion of total income. This indicates that monetization opportunities are highly concentrated among a small number of channels, pointing to a “winner-takes-all” dynamic.

Actionable Insights for YouTube Creators:
